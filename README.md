👋 Hey there!

I'm Koimett Benjamin, a developer-in-progress based in Kenya 🇰🇪.Currently exploring the wild world of web dev — from HTML & CSS all the way to Go and Rust. 

🧠 I'm here to learn, build, and break things (on purpose... mostly).💻 My current stack is beginner-friendly but growing every week.

🌱 What I'm Learning

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Backend: Node.js, Express, Go (Golang)

Tools: Git, VS Code, Postman, and the magical art of Stack Overflow searches

🧪 Things I’m Playing With

A simple To-Do App (because tradition)

A basic REST API in Go

Mini UI projects using React

🚧 Goals for 2025

Contribute to open source (even if it’s just fixing typos 😅)

Build a portfolio site

Learn how to test, deploy, and not panic when stuff breaks
